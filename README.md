# *Faster* R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks

By Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun at Microsoft Research

### Introduction

**Faster R-CNN** is a framework for object detection with deep ConvNets including windows proposal network (RPN) and detection network. These two networks are trained for sharing convolution layers to speed up testing speed. 

Faster R-CNN was initially described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).
